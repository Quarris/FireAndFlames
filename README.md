Fire and Flames allows you to craft tools and armour using materials that you processed in a Crucible.

The Crucible is a core component of Fire and Flames. A multiblock structure to smelt your ores and create alloys.

Crucible is powered by heat from solid and fluid sources.

Smelt your ores to get more than you would in a normal furnace!

Cast your molten goodies into the Casting Table and Basin to form them into ingots and blocks.
